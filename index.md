## Past, Present, and Future

# DevOps: The Company Killer

* Everyone wants global deployments.
* Not everyone should should roll their own.
* DevOps is draining companies dry.

---

## What if Heroku, but also Edge?

* CDNs have been distributing assets globally for years.
* Docker images look and smell like static assets.
* "Dynamic Delivery Network" - how hard could it be?

---

# Platform: First Pass

* Flexible hosting: Cloud, On-Prem, Colo.
* "Push to Deploy", logging, billing, etc.
* Simple matter of signing on **thousands** of hosting providers.
* _On second thought,_ let's make a marketplace...
* Yeah, that's the ticket.

---

# Marketplace: DEX

- Transparent pricing (history).
- Simple payments (in principle).
- **UNSTOPPABLE** (fault-tolerant).

---

> **_The revolution will not be centralized!_**

- **The Platform**: hosting, management.

Reverse auction.
